# 4. Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year.

# Define the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period
principal = 200
rate_of_interest = 5
time_period = 5

# Calculate the simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * rate_of_interest * time_period) / 100

# Display the result
print(f"The simple interest on Rs. {principal} for {time_period} years at {rate_of_interest}% per year is Rs. {simple_interest}.")
